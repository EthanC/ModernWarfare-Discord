# ModernWarfare-Discord

Trick your friends into thinking that you're playing the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Multiplayer months before the beta or full release!

This application will set your [Discord Rich Presence](https://youtu.be/Ss-IvNjl7JQ) to a randomly generated Multiplayer match using the currently known maps and modes.

Notice: This is not intended to be a maintained or serious project. While bug fixes may be made, new features and data will not be added.

## Usage

You must be using the [Windows Client of Discord](https://discordapp.com/download) and have Game Activity enabled under User Settings.

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EthanC/ModernWarfare-Discord/releases/latest)
- Run the `Modern.Warfare.RPC.Setup.X.X.X.exe` installer

## Customization

While not recommended, you could [create your own Rich Presence application](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to), then modify `index.js` and `gameData.js` to allow for custom maps, modes, and images to be used.

## Discord

While you're at it, come hang out in the [Call of Duty Discord Server](https://discord.gg/callofduty)!
